# Pillars Of Creation
Pillars of Creation is a web-based idle game based on Eve Online set in a time when humanity is just leaving the Sol system and exploring the galaxy.

There's no public documentation on implementation right now, mainly because there is no game right now. ðŸ™‚  I'm using the game as a way to learn Blazor WebAssembly in my spare time.

### Reading the Commit History
Commit messages should use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) with the descriptors listed below.  For the scope please use the name of the feature.

Breaking changes **must** contain a line prefixed with `BREAKING CHANGE:` so [versionize](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Versionize/) recognizes a breaking change.  Breaking changes can use any commit type.
