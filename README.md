# Pillars Of Creation
Pillars of Creation is a web-based idle game based on Eve Online set in a time when humanity is just leaving the Sol system and exploring the galaxy.

There's no public documentation on implementation right now, mainly because there is no game right now. ðŸ™‚  I'm using the game as a way to learn Blazor WebAssembly in my spare time.
